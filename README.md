# PSGMarketingResearch

This project came from a course in which I had to analyze a local company, create a marketing research survey, and use SPSS to analyze the resultls. I chose to focus my project on a local cactus and succulent nursery to determine different types of advertising the owner could use to see an increase in customers. I used Qualtrics to send my survey out to several of my peers at the University of Oregon and SPSS to analyze the final results. 

The final report included in this repository examines both my findings within the analysis and recommendations for the local company to increase business.
